    <h1>Fried Rice</h1>
    <p>Fried rice is a staple of Asian cuisine. Typically
        it is cooked using leftover rice, as the rice has
        been dehydrated and cooled down so the heat doesn't
        overcook it. A simple dish, it serves as a way to cook
        in any leftover rice with whatever ingredients lie
        within the fridge from previous days.
